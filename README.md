# 🚀 GraphQL Backend Playground
>[!NOTE]
> Designing, developing, testing, and playing with a **GraphQL-based backend** — laying the foundation for building scalable systems in the future.

## 🧠 About

This project is my personal **backend lab**, where I:

- Explore and implement GraphQL APIs
- Learn query design, mutations, resolvers, and schema modeling
- Build a flexible, testable, and scalable backend architecture

It's a stepping stone toward building more **complex and production-ready** backend systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **GraphQL** (`express-graphql`, `graphql-tools`)

> [!NOTE]
> ### 📘 Why These Notes?
> I have the memory of a goldfish 😅, and flipping through documentation while coding can be confusing.  
> These notes are my personal anchor when navigating GraphQL docs.
>
> AND Yes, I **use colors** because- life’s so gray (not *grey*)... at least notes should have colors😂  Also, some compensation for my **not so nice** handwriting🤧!

> #### 🗂️ Why include them *here*?
> Because... **why not?** 😄
