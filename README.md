## 🧠 About

This project is my personal **backend lab**, where I:

- Explore and implement GraphQL APIs
- Learn query design, mutations, resolvers, and schema modeling
- Build a flexible, testable, and scalable backend architecture

It's a stepping stone toward building more **complex and production-ready** backend systems.
